            I see web design and frontend development as a form of art blending
            creativity with structure. What fascinates me is the challenge of
            crafting engaging and visually appealing designs while working within
            a structured ruleset that ensures the best experience for users.

            To enhance my design skills further, I also completed a graphic design
            course, helping me refine my ability to create visually compelling and
            user-friendly interfaces

            I have completed my studies as a Data Technician specializing in
            programming. Throughout my education, many of my projects focused on
            web development, allowing me to gain experience in frontend, backend,
            and database management.{" "}
